# Feature Prioritization Matrix

## Framework
Using the MoSCoW method (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)

## Must Have (Core Features)
These features are essential for the MVP and cannot be deferred.

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| User Registration | Allow users to create accounts | Must Have |
| Task Creation | Users can create and manage tasks | Must Have |
| Score Tracking | Track progress and scores | Must Have |
| Mobile Responsiveness | Mobile-first design approach | Must Have |

## Should Have (Important but Not Critical)
These features enhance the product but are not essential for the initial release.

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Social Sharing | Share achievements with others | Should Have |
| Progress Visualization | Charts and graphs showing progress | Should Have |
| Task Categories | Organize tasks into categories | Should Have |

## Could Have (Nice to Have)
These features would be valuable but can be implemented later.

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Notifications | In-app and push notifications | Could Have |
| Advanced Filtering | Filter tasks by various criteria | Could Have |
| Leaderboards | Show rankings among users | Could Have |

## Won't Have (Out of Scope)
These features are explicitly excluded from the MVP.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Advanced Analytics | Too complex for initial release |
| Complex Authentication | Beyond basic login/signup needs |
| Social Media Integration | External dependencies |
| Offline Mode | Requires significant architecture changes |
| Advanced Leaderboard Options | Complex filtering and sorting |

## Prioritization Criteria
1. Business Value: How much does it benefit the user?
2. Technical Complexity: How difficult is it to implement?
3. Time to Market: How quickly can it be delivered?
4. Resource Availability: What resources are needed?

## Decision Process
1. Stakeholders review and approve the prioritization matrix
2. Development team estimates implementation effort
3. Adjust priorities based on technical feasibility
4. Final approval before development begins
