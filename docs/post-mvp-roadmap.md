# Post-MVP Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for the SosyalApp beyond the MVP scope. These features were intentionally deferred from the initial release to allow for focused development of core functionality.

## Deferred Features with Rationale

### 1. Advanced Analytics and Reporting
- **Rationale**: Complex data analysis requires significant backend infrastructure and processing power that was outside the MVP scope.
- **Business Value**: High - provides valuable insights for users and helps improve platform engagement.
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium - requires additional data processing pipelines and visualization components.
- **Time to Market**: Medium - can be delivered within 3-4 months after MVP launch.
- **Resource Requirements**: Medium - requires additional developer time and potentially new tools.

### 2. Push Notification System
- **Rationale**: Basic notification system was sufficient for MVP, but push notifications require integration with external services.
- **Business Value**: High - improves user retention and engagement.
- **Technical Complexity**: Low - relatively straightforward integration with push notification services.
- **Time to Market**: Short - can be implemented quickly once infrastructure is in place.
- **Resource Requirements**: Low - minimal additional resources required.

### 3. Social Media Integration
- **Rationale**: External integrations were deemed too complex for initial release.
- **Business Value**: Medium - increases user reach and engagement.
- **Technical Complexity**: High - requires OAuth integration and handling of various social platforms.
- **Time to Market**: Long - several months due to complexity.
- **Resource Requirements**: High - requires dedicated engineering effort.

### 4. Offline Mode Support
- **Rationale**: Mobile-first responsive design was prioritized over offline capabilities.
- **Business Value**: Medium - enhances user experience in low-connectivity areas.
- **Technical Complexity**: High - requires complex local storage management and synchronization logic.
- **Time to Market**: Long - significant development time required.
- **Resource Requirements**: High - substantial engineering investment needed.

### 5. Advanced Filtering Options
- **Rationale**: Simple filtering was sufficient for MVP; advanced filters require more sophisticated UI/UX design.
- **Business Value**: Medium - improves search and discovery experience.
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium - requires enhanced search algorithms and UI components.
- **Time to Market**: Medium - can be developed within 2-3 months.
- **Resource Requirements**: Medium - moderate development effort.

### 6. Leaderboard Features
- **Rationale**: Basic progress tracking was included; leaderboards require additional data processing and ranking algorithms.
- **Business Value**: High - drives competition and user engagement.
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium - needs real-time ranking calculations and display components.
- **Time to Market**: Medium - can be implemented within 3 months.
- **Resource Requirements**: Medium - requires backend processing and UI development.

## Priority Ordering

Based on business value and technical feasibility, the features are prioritized as follows:

1. **Push Notification System** (High Business Value, Low Technical Complexity)
2. **Advanced Analytics and Reporting** (High Business Value, Medium Technical Complexity)
3. **Leaderboard Features** (High Business Value, Medium Technical Complexity)
4. **Advanced Filtering Options** (Medium Business Value, Medium Technical Complexity)
5. **Offline Mode Support** (Medium Business Value, High Technical Complexity)
6. **Social Media Integration** (Medium Business Value, High Technical Complexity)

## Resource Estimation

| Feature | Estimated Development Time | Required Resources |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Push Notification System | 2 weeks | 1 Developer |
| Advanced Analytics | 4 weeks | 2 Developers |
| Leaderboard Features | 3 weeks | 1 Developer |
| Advanced Filtering | 3 weeks | 1 Developer |
| Offline Mode Support | 6 weeks | 2 Developers |
| Social Media Integration | 8 weeks | 2 Developers |

## Implementation Timeline

The post-MVP features will be implemented in phases:

### Phase 1 (Months 1-2)
- Push Notification System
- Advanced Analytics and Reporting

### Phase 2 (Months 3-4)
- Leaderboard Features
- Advanced Filtering Options

### Phase 3 (Months 5-6)
- Offline Mode Support
- Social Media Integration

## Stakeholder Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Weekly status updates to development team
- Monthly progress reports to stakeholders
- Quarterly business review meetings

### External Communication
- Feature announcements via email newsletters
- Product updates on social media channels
- Documentation updates for developers

## Project Continuation Documentation

This roadmap serves as the foundation for continued development of the SosyalApp. It ensures that future enhancements align with both business objectives and technical capabilities while maintaining focus on delivering value to users.
